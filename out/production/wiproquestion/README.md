1 Write a program to print factorial of N ( without using any loop)

There is an animal class which has the common characteristics of all animals. Dog, Horse, Cat are animals(sub-class).
Each can shout, but each shout is different. Use polymorphism to create objects of same and using an animal
variable, make each of the animals shout.

Create an abstract class Instrument which is having the abstract function play. Create three more sub classes 
from Instrument which is Piano, Flute, Guitar. Override the play method inside all three classes printing a 
message “Piano is playing tan tan tan tan ” for Piano class “Flute is playing toot toot toot toot” for
Flute class “Guitar is playing tin tin tin ” for Guitar class Create an array of 10 Instruments. 
Assign different type of instrument to Instrument reference. Check for the polymorphic behavior of play method.

Write an interface called Playable, with a method void play(); Let this interface be placed in a package called 
music.Write a class called Veena which implements Playable interface. Let this class be placed in a package music.
string.Write a class called Saxophone which implements Playable interface. Let this class be placed in a package 
music.wind.Write another class Test in a package called live. Then, a. Create an instance of Veena and call play()
method b. Create an instance of  Saxophone and call play() method c. Place the above instances in a variable of
type Playable and then call play().

Write a program to accept name and age of a person from the command prompt(passed as arguments when you 
execute the class) 
and ensure that the age entered is >=18 and < 60.
Display proper error messages. The program must exit gracefully after displaying the error message in 
case the arguments passed are not proper. (Hint : Create a user defined exception class for handling errors.)
